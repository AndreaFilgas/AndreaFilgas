### The Challenge

The General Register of Employed and Unemployed (CAGED) was created as a permanent record of admissions and dismissals of brazilian employees, under the Consolidation of Labor Laws (CLT) regime.

It is used by the Unemployment Insurance Program, to check data relating to employment relationships, in addition to other social programs.

This Register also serves as a basis for the elaboration of studies, research, projects and programs related to the labor market, at the same time that it subsidizes decision-making for government actions.

After that, we can start our analysis:

  1.  Import the libraries and read the data: Import the necessary libraries and check the data face and its basic information about the contents of the columns.
  
  2.  Cleaning and transformation of the target variable Monthly Salary: check the data type of the Monthly Salary variable, make the necessary changes, plot the distribution and dispersion of the data and apply the mathematical transformation to correct the asymmetry.

  3.  Verification of the data for the Age variable: check the data for the Age variable, plot a distribution and a dispersion, calculate the correlation with the monthly salary variable and interpret the results.

  4.  Verification of the data of the Instruction Grade variable: check the data of the Instruction Grade variable, plot a distribution and a dispersion, calculate the correlation with the monthly salary variable and interpret the results.

  5.  Verification of the data of the variable Gender: check the data of the variable Sex, plot a distribution and a dispersion, calculate the correlation with the variable monthly salary and interpret the results. After that, make a statistical inference to see if men earn more than women.

  6.  Verification of the data of the Race Color variable: check the data of the Race Color variable, plot a distribution and a dispersion, calculate the correlation with the monthly salary variable and interpret the results. After that, make a statistical inference to see if whites earn more than other ethnic groups.

  7.  Develop a hypothesis to be rejected or not rejected by you according to the result of your analysis, using the CAJED data considering its columns.

  8.  Advanced: plot a SEABORN heatmap with all the correlations of the numerical variables to each other.

  9.  Advanced: Plot a multiple regression.
