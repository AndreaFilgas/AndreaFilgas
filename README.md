# Andrea Filgas Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science and data analysis projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 

## About me

I am a highly international data scientist and project manager with a Master’s Degree in Social Entrepreneurship from Hult International Business School in the US and Economics Degree from FGV in Brazil. I´ve just completed a Data Science course at Digital House SP.

Within the past 7 years, I have worked for an array of different sectors in positions of operations and data analysis to improve on my craft before reaching for my dream. From developing an efficiency and prioritization metric at Gympass that reduced the response time to clients by up to 75%, to restructuring the Marketing and Sales department at Ideias Energia, that lead to a new website and inbound campaign. I have worked my best to learn new tools and strategies to deliver the constant new improvements for the team and the corporations.

I thrive on challenges and I am also quite persistent that data is only good data if everyone can read it.
